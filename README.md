# Organisation Overview: 
Green Crescent Trust (GCT) is a non-profit organization in Sindh, Pakistan, that focuses on development through education. It was established in 1994 by a group of critically conscious and passionate citizens with one goal: making a better Pakistan by providing access to quality education. It started out with just one school and a few students in Karachi.

GCT is operated by professionals under the supervision of the Board of Trustees, which now runs a network of more than 150 schools in underserved areas of Sindh. GCT aims to shift mindsets in the communities regarding education by providing opportunities to bring enhancements to their daily lives. It has also expanded its services through other programs like the Orphan Support Program (OSP), Center for Educational Research and Development (CERD), and The Water Project.
